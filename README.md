Read the README, yes very good keep going.


===== PROJECT DESCRIPTION =====

Assignment was to create a website for a fictional company (Either a gourmet restaurant or a charity for moving nature back into cities).

The site was not supposed to be fully functional, such as the contact page actually functioning. Meaning the site should just be made visually ready.

Either way, the contact.css file was corrupted shortly before submission with no time to remake it, so expect the contact section to have no styling what-so-ever.
(Just trust that it was epic and very cool)
